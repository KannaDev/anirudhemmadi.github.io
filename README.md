<h2> About Me: </h2>
<p>Hello there! I am a High School senior at <strong><a href="http://www.coppellisd.com/Domain/151" target="_blank">Coppell High School</a></strong>, set to graduate next month. I am planning on pursing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at <strong><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Dallas</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Programming in general has been very influential and is a key component in my life. I first started programming when I was in 9th Grade (2014) as it was required to graduate in my previous high school in India (<strong><a href="http://www.dpsnacharam.in/" target="_blank">Delhi Public School</a></strong>). I simply loved it. After I moved to the U.S. in 2016 for the remainder of high school, I was eager to choose the Computer Science track. The first actual programming language I learnt was Java. </p>
<p>However, I was not satisfied with what I was learning with Java at school as it was mostly just printing out into the console, which is useless in the real world. I started building my own <strong><a href="http://www.github.com/kanna6501" target="_blank">programs</a></strong>, attended various hackathons and events in the past year (2017). With my knowledge of java I started looking into Android app development and was very interested in it. However, it was too time-consuming and was simply too much as I was learning Java at school, and I already set my schedule to learn web development. I had to push app development further down the year, and I can't wait to start that.</p>
<p>I am currently learning <strong><a href="http://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Web Development</a></strong> and plan to learn the whole thing (Full-Stack) mainly for freelancing purposes (and making websites is awesome!). I also plan to learn Python (Professionally) and App Development later this year.</p>
